<p><em>
  CVSS values listed are those of the highest scoring CVEs for any listed version.
  The highest possible score is <span class="xr"><strong>10.0</strong></span>, indicating that a version is considered
  to be <span class="xr"><strong>❌ extremely unsafe</strong></span>. The lowest possible score is
  <span class="xg"><strong>0.0</strong></span>, indicating that a version is <strong><em>currently</em></strong>
  considered to be <span class="xg"><strong>✔️ safe</strong></span> (although, other designations are possible,
  depending on other factors, such as whether the product has reached EoL, is still actively supported, is still under
  development and therefore whether it's ready to be used in a production environment and etc).<br />
  <br />
  Versions will also be marked as either <span class="xg"><strong>✔️ safe</strong></span> or
  <span class="xr"><strong>❌ unsafe</strong></span> accordingly, or as
  <span class="xb"><strong>➖ in development</strong></span> (versions marked as in development may be safe, but aren't
  yet considered to be ready for a production environment, or may have a changing codebase, which therefore can't yet
  be predicated as either safe or unsafe), or as <span class="xo"><strong>〰️ disputed</strong></span> (CVEs exist, and
  there are sources which identify the version as unsafe, but the CVE or unsafe designation may be disputed, either by
  the vendor itself or alternate sources).<br />
  <br />
  Please note that a <span class="xg"><strong>✔️ safe</strong></span> designation does <span class="xr"><strong>NOT</strong></span> mean that the designated versions are <strong>free from bugs and errors</strong>!
  When a new "patch release" becomes available, in general, these patch releases rectify various problems, bugs and so forth which could be encountered when using outdated versions from prior to the particular patch release.
  As such, using the latest version for any particular branch is always advised in favour of using older, outdated versions.<br />
