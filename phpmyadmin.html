<p><em>
  All information is derived from <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/">CVEDetails.com</a> unless otherwise stated.
  CVSS values listed are those of the highest scoring CVEs for any listed version.
  The highest possible score is <span class="xr"><strong>10.0</strong></span>, indicating that a version is considered to be <span class="xr"><strong>extremely unsafe</strong></span>.
  The lowest possible score is <span class="xg"><strong>0.0</strong></span>, indicating that a version is <strong>currently</strong> considered to be <span class="xg"><strong>safe</strong></span>.<br />
  <br />
  There may also be additional considerations as to whether a version should be considered <span class="xg"><strong>safe</strong></span> or <span class="xr"><strong>unsafe</strong></span>,
  such as whether the version is still being actively supported, whether it is appropriate to use in production environments, etc.
  As such, versions will also be marked as either <span class="xg"><strong>✔️ safe</strong></span>, <span class="xr"><strong>❌ unsafe</strong></span>, or as <span class="xb"><strong>➖ in development</strong></span> (versions marked as in development may be safe, but aren't yet considered to be ready for a production environment).<br />
  <br />
